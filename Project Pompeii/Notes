LGA1151 Socket (Coffee Lake Standard)
- Socket must have a BGA.
- Heated to 200-300C
- Whole socket must be replaced as pins for DDR, VCCSA, PEG_R, 
  and VCCGT are damaged
- Board warmer is helpful but not needed. 
- BGA solder balls with either be Tin or Lead. Flux, Solder paste, and Hot air may be needed to 
 reball the socket easier. 
- Caution must be ensured as damaging traces on multi-layer PCB's will often make the board unsalvagable as 
  manufacturing equipment is needed in the repair process. 
Safety Precautions
- Eye protection
- Fireproof / Resistant Surface
- Ensure board components are protected using something 
  with thermal insulation such as Kapton Tape. Otherwise there is risk of
 damaging / exploding the inductors or capacitors near by the socket on the VRM.
